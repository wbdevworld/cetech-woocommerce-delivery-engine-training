# Technical Support Appendix

**Audience:** Technical support and developers **only**  
**Normal staff should not require this document.**

**Plugin:** CETECH WooCommerce Delivery Engine **1.0.0-rc.9** (schema **5**). Includes Cart/Checkout Blocks, overlapping Delivery Area pricing, and constrained fallback.  
**Schema target:** `5`  
**Release identity:** Git tag `v1.0.0-rc.9` (do not rewrite). Tags `v1.0.0-rc.8` through `v1.0.0-rc.2` remain untouched.

If WordPress shows a different plugin version, stop and confirm which package is installed before following this appendix.

## Feature flags (operational names)

Required production switches (Classic Checkout **and** Cart/Checkout Blocks):

- Use Site-wide Defaults at checkout — ON  
- Use Site-wide Defaults for product variations — ON  
- Show delivery choices on product pages — ON  
- Remember the customer’s delivery choice in the cart — ON  
- Validate delivery choice at checkout — ON  
- Show delivery fees at checkout — ON  
- Save delivery details on orders — ON  

Shipment records and customer tracking links stay **OFF** until an Administrator turns them on in Settings. Not in this release: customer timeline, carrier APIs, automatic tracking updates, Delivery Engine shipment emails. Cart/Checkout Blocks **are** implemented. Settings shows Blocks and optional integrations as **status**, not experimental checkboxes.

Do not flip Advanced cutover switches without a change window and owner approval.

**Cash on Delivery:** production storefront policy remains **OFF**. If COD is used, Delivery Engine does **not** create a shipment until payment is confirmed. Staff create that shipment from the Order ID. Do not mark an order paid just to force a shipment.

## Internal concepts (support only)

| Concept | Why support cares | Staff should see |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Configuration scopes / fields / collections | Schema target **4**; per-profile `global/0/{profile_key}` Site-wide Defaults | Site-wide Defaults / Product Exceptions UI |
| EffectiveConfigurationResolver | GLOBAL → PRODUCT → VARIATION field inheritance + hard constraints | Preview Delivery “Currently using” / Ready |
| Order delivery snapshots | Immutable post-payment delivery facts (`_cetech_de_*`) | Delivery information panel |
| Public presentation contract | Compact option + estimate; shipping `rate_label` prefers public option name | Customer product / thank-you / email |
| Older product-rule storage (hidden) | Compatibility rows may still exist; not a staff menu | Staff use Site-wide Defaults / Product Exceptions |
| Shipping method `delivery_engine_selected_offer` | WC method listed in Add shipping method while the plugin is active; rates stay flag-gated; label prefers public Delivery Option | Checkout shipping line |
| Region State / Region rules | Match WooCommerce state **code or** that country’s label (Ghana `AA` / Greater Accra); no area-data migration | Delivery Areas tester vs checkout |
| Shipment records (default OFF) | Schema-4 shipment / item / event tables; built from the **saved order** delivery groups | **Delivery Engine → Shipments** after an Administrator enables shipment records |
| Customer tracking links (default OFF) | Safe `http` / `https` URL only; no carrier polling | **Track shipment** on View Order when a safe URL is saved |
| AdministratorAccessRecovery | `manage_options` + nonce; independent of diagnostics | Restore Administrator Access notice |

---

## Diagnostics (support)

- Hidden **Technical diagnostic tools** (`view_delivery_diagnostics`) — not a normal submenu  
- Delivery Charges test / Delivery Areas address tester  
- Preview Delivery (contextual)  
- PHP error log review for Delivery Engine fatals  

Do not instruct ordinary staff to run WP-CLI, SQL, Redis FLUSHALL, Nginx edits, or Code Snippets.

Administrator lockout repair is **Restore Administrator Access**, authorised by native `manage_options`. It must not depend on diagnostics capability.

---

## Runtime compatibility notes

- WooCommerce is authoritative for commerce workflows; HPOS-compatible order CRUD.  
- Classic Checkout remains available. Cart/Checkout Blocks use the same Delivery Engine pricing, validation, and order snapshots.  
- Core must not depend on WoodMart.  
- Never trust browser-submitted authoritative delivery prices.  
- Missing / malformed / nonnumeric rates fail closed — never silent free shipping. Explicit configured numeric zero is allowed (including Store pickup).  
- Never silently replace a customer’s selected Delivery Option.  
- International Delivery = Air and/or Sea only. Air and Sea are separate delivery groups / shipments.  
- In Warehouse = local delivery only (no Air/Sea/pickup leak).  
- Matched overlapping Delivery Areas: quote the same selected option against broader matches only when the more-specific area has **no matching charge** for that option. Invalid more-specific charges fail closed.  
- Store pickup is not a delivery shipment.  
- Suppliers, origins, and private logistics stay off customer surfaces.  
- Historical order delivery snapshots remain immutable. Shipments are built from that saved order data, not from today’s product settings.  
- Do not start Stage 15, carrier APIs, or WPML/WCML/WCFM/VitePOS adapters from this appendix.

## Rollback / release identity

- Protected published baseline: tagged `v1.0.0-rc.9`, schema `5`. Do not retag RC.9 or earlier.  
- Frozen Blocks.4 source was promoted to RC.9. Record: `docs/RC9-FINALIZATION.md`. Constrained fallback: `docs/POST-RC8-BLOCKS-4-CONSTRAINED-FALLBACK.md`.  
- Historical tagged `v1.0.0-rc.8` (schema `5`), `v1.0.0-rc.7` (schema `5`) and `v1.0.0-rc.6` (schema `4`) remain untouched.  
- Historical RC.6 package `cetech-woocommerce-delivery-engine-1.0.0-rc.6.zip` remains immutable (`1059918` bytes, SHA-256 `0d4adbef50462d798a4ff9bf802643bed92a35cdd332ceee13a985dbda2a689d`, source `7e52525`). Full RC.6 record: `docs/STAGE-14H-RC6-FINAL.md`.  
- Do not alter tags `v1.0.0-rc.9` through `v1.0.0-rc.2`. Do not overwrite historical QA ZIPs.

Staff training markdown lives in `docs/training/` in the plugin repository. It is **not** gitignored. Screenshot/video binaries and `training/playwright/` auth stay gitignored. Training docs are **not** part of the production plugin ZIP.

---

## Playwright documentation harness

`training/playwright/` was built for older label/screenshot capture. It has **not** been rewritten for current menus. Auth storage is gitignored. Do not claim visual capture from that harness until it is updated.
