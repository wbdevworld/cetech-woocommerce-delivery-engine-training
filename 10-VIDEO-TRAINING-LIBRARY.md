# Video Training Library — CETECH Delivery Engine

**Plugin version:** 1.0.0-rc.8 (schema 5; training-site package `1.0.0-dev.blocks.4`)  
**Status:** Recapture **deferred**. Written guides are the teaching authority until new recordings exist.

Older recordings use different menu names and an older customer layout. **Do not use them as current truth.** If an old name appears in a leftover file, the mapping is only in the [Troubleshooting FAQ](07-TROUBLESHOOTING-FAQ.md).

When recordings are made later, replace binaries under [`assets/videos/`](assets/videos/) and update this index. Narration scripts in `video-scripts/` will need a rewrite to match the live screens. Until then, trainers tick [13 — Feature coverage](13-FEATURE-COVERAGE-AND-CONFIRMATION.md) on the live site.

- Do not place extra paid orders.  
- Do not capture credentials, Cloudflare challenge, or customer PII.  
- Auth state stays in gitignored `training/playwright/auth/`.  
- Update this file’s Status column when a binary actually exists and matches the live 1.0.0-rc.8 / blocks.4 screens.
