## What this plugin is (in one minute)

The Delivery Engine helps the store:

1. Set **normal delivery rules once** (Site-wide Defaults).
2. Show customers a clear **Delivery option** and **Estimated delivery**.
3. Charge the correct **delivery fee** at checkout.
4. Keep **Delivery information** on the WooCommerce order after payment.
5. When shipment records are enabled, work **delivery shipments** from **Delivery Engine → Shipments**.

Most products should follow the store defaults. Only genuinely different products or variations get exceptions.

## Safe practice products (QA)

Use these dedicated QA products. Do **not** change real customer catalogue products just to practise.

| ID | What it is |
|----|------------|
| **#39705** | Simple QA product |
| **#39717** | Variable parent QA product |
| **#39718** | Variation A |
| **#39719** | Variation B |

Read-only order examples: **#39721** (variable), **#39724** (multi-product). Do not edit historical delivery details.

## Everyday Delivery Engine menu

When setup is complete, staff should see:

- Overview
- Site-wide Defaults
- Delivery Options
- Delivery Areas
- Delivery Charges
- Pickup Locations
- Product Exceptions
- **Bulk Tools** (authorised administrators only — not everyday catalog work)
- **Shipments** (only after an Administrator turns on shipment records)
- Needs Attention
- Settings

**Setup Guide** appears in the menu only while first-time setup is incomplete. After that, reopen it from **Settings → Run Setup Guide Again**.

**Preview Delivery** is not a left-menu item. Open it from a product’s **Delivery** tab or from Overview.

If a menu item is **not** on the everyday list above, do not use it. Ask an administrator. Old names from older guides are listed only in the [Troubleshooting FAQ](07-TROUBLESHOOTING-FAQ.md).

## Golden rules for all roles

1. Configure **normal rules once** on Site-wide Defaults. Most products should inherit them.
2. Customize a product or variation **only** for the fields that must differ. Inheritance is field-by-field.
3. Check **Preview Delivery** after important changes.
4. Never invent free shipping by leaving pricing incomplete.
5. Do not change past orders’ delivery details to “fix” future settings — historical orders keep what the customer paid for.
6. Ask an administrator before changing Settings switches, Access, or anything that is not in the everyday menu.
7. Customers should see a public **Delivery option** and **Estimated delivery** — never supplier, origin, or internal codes.
8. When **Shipments** is on, work the delivery job there. Do not rewrite the delivery details already saved on a paid order.
9. Classic Checkout and Cart/Checkout Blocks are both supported. Confirm the fee on the checkout type this store actually uses.
10. A city Delivery Area can sit inside a region. Do **not** copy the same Delivery Charge onto every city so Air “works”. The broader area can supply that option’s fee when the city has no charge for it.
